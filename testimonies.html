            The Creative Problem Solving Model opened my eyes as to how efficient a methodology can be. CPS organizes
            itself into several well defined stages which allows for its framework to be used and applied by all kinds
            of people.
            <br> </br>
            As someone with ADD; chunking is a very effective strategy to take on work and tasks. Dividing itself into 4
            segments, the process is easy to understand and effective to use, even for someone like me.
            <br> </br>
            I used to think that coming up with thought out solutions to challenges was something primarily limited to
            business and commerce. When in reality, problem solving is versatile and can be applied to many areas in our
            lives.
            <br> </br>
            One thing that CPS made me realize was my ability to take on more of a leadership role. It gave me the tools
            to work more collaboratively and better as a team. I had never thought I would enjoy or be able to break
            down an issue, gather data and analyze it to come up with effective solutions.
            <br> </br>
            Working as a team, my group used the CPS method to tackle the issue of student housing. With the use of
            digital collaborative tools such as Jamboard and Mural; we were able to visualize and collaborate ideas with
            clarity.
            <br> </br>
            Learning about the different activities to spark creativity in the ideate stage was both interesting and
            useful to me. Sorting ideas towards a focused goal with targeting really helped with decision making. I can
            often be indecisive, but having a very effective method eliminates the overthinking I tend to do.
            <br> </br>
            Overall I enjoyed my experience learning about the CPS methodology. It is an effective framework that allows
            us to be more creative, confident and self aware about ourselves and others.

          I was good friends with this girl back from middle school. She wrote me a really mean letter which at the end, I choose to rip art. My two other friends, had influenced me to do this. This had an impact on our friendship, as I stopped talking to her after that incident. I tried communicating with her after that, and now we are friends again; just not that close. I learned from my failure is to not let anyone influence me, and to communicate my feelings with others.

            Growing up, I struggled with school due to a learning disability that went undiagnosed until age five, leaving me feeling inadequate and ashamed of my academic struggles. However, when my family relocated to Canada for a more inclusive education things began to change. In this new
            environment, I discovered diversity and received support tailored to my learning needs, which allowed me to
            embrace my uniqueness and let go of the pressure to conform to arbitrary standards. With the encouragement
            of supportive teachers, I learned to appreciate my strengths, particularly as a kinesthetic learner, leading
            to my success in rhythmic gymnastics, culminating in participation in world championships. Reflecting on my
            journey, I now recognize that past failures were instrumental in discovering my true capabilities, and I
            credit my parents' sacrifices for enabling my growth and achievements.
            Happy FAIL-A-BRATION!
