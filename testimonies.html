            The Creative Problem Solving Model opened my eyes as to how efficient a methodology can be. CPS organizes
            itself into several well defined stages which allows for its framework to be used and applied by all kinds
            of people.
            <br> </br>
            As someone with ADD; chunking is a very effective strategy to take on work and tasks. Dividing itself into 4
            segments, the process is easy to understand and effective to use, even for someone like me.
            <br> </br>
            I used to think that coming up with thought out solutions to challenges was something primarily limited to
            business and commerce. When in reality, problem solving is versatile and can be applied to many areas in our
            lives.
            <br> </br>
            One thing that CPS made me realize was my ability to take on more of a leadership role. It gave me the tools
            to work more collaboratively and better as a team. I had never thought I would enjoy or be able to break
            down an issue, gather data and analyze it to come up with effective solutions.
            <br> </br>
            Working as a team, my group used the CPS method to tackle the issue of student housing. With the use of
            digital collaborative tools such as Jamboard and Mural; we were able to visualize and collaborate ideas with
            clarity.
            <br> </br>
            Learning about the different activities to spark creativity in the ideate stage was both interesting and
            useful to me. Sorting ideas towards a focused goal with targeting really helped with decision making. I can
            often be indecisive, but having a very effective method eliminates the overthinking I tend to do.
            <br> </br>
            Overall I enjoyed my experience learning about the CPS methodology. It is an effective framework that allows
            us to be more creative, confident and self aware about ourselves and others.

          <p>
            Growing up, I grappled with school due to a learning disability that went undiagnosed until age five in Hong
            Kong's educational system, leaving me feeling inadequate and ashamed of my academic struggles. However, a
            pivotal change came when my family relocated to Canada for a more inclusive education. In this new
            environment, I discovered diversity and received support tailored to my learning needs, which allowed me to
            embrace my uniqueness and let go of the pressure to conform to arbitrary standards. With the encouragement
            of supportive teachers, I learned to appreciate my strengths, particularly as a kinesthetic learner, leading
            to my success in rhythmic gymnastics, culminating in participation in world championships. Reflecting on my
            journey, I now recognize that past failures were instrumental in discovering my true capabilities, and I
            credit my parents' sacrifices for enabling my growth and achievements.
            Happy FAIL-A-BRATION!

            I believe Creative Problem Solving methodology is such a great way to solve a problem. I was assigned to a
            group and was to find a problem to solve. The group agreed with going for a sleep issue with students. Using
            the methodology, we were able to take step by step process and reach our final goal of getting a good
            solution to the problem.
            <br> </br>
            During the process, one of the memorable moments I had was when team-mates and I had to bring up the ideas.
            I believe the ideate stage during the process was the most interesting since I was able to see how others
            may bring up ideas, and how they thought about the problem. There were challenging moments where we had to
            start finding realistic solutions to our problems. Since we had to consider the target audience we have
            chosen for the problem, and how it should fit with many factors, it was difficult to find the best answer
            from the ideas. But at the end when we finally reached an agreement to a certain idea, it was one of the
            unforgettable moments.
            <br> </br>
            Furthermore, with the methodology, I felt the importance of cooperation when solving the problem. The
            methodology is very effective to find a creative problem, but when it comes to a cooperative team, it brings
            a greater effect to the result. It was hard at moments where we had to find the right time for everyone to
            join the meeting and discuss the ideas, but finalizing the idea, I have learnt how effective it can be with
            both the method and a good team.
            <br> </br>
            It was a great decision to use the Creative Problem Solving methodology as a way to solve a problem and I am
            planning to apply the methodology on whatever I can too.
