        <h2 class="dez-h2">Introduction</h2>

        <p class="format">CPS, or Creative Problem Solving is a way for designers to find a better and
          greater solution to a problem. When it comes to solving a problem, there are many things that should be considered.
          The CPS is basically a guideline for designers on how to start from brainstorming to ideate and finally
          implementing the solution.</p>

        <p class="format">When it comes to problems, we can categorize them. There are two categories of problems
          which are wicked and systematic.</p>

        <ol>
          <li class="dez-h3">Wicked Problem:</li>
          <p class="format"> wicked problem is a complicated problem that cannot be solved with one answer. It cannot be
            solved only by one solution as there are many factors that follow with the problem which makes it difficult
            to solve. Designers who use the model are to use the CPS as a method to break down the problem, and untangle
            the problem to find the best out of different solutions that come up.
            e.g) global warming, climate change, world hunger, affording housing.</p>

          <li class="dez-h3">Systemic problem:</li>
          <p class="format"> Systemic problem is the problem connected with the surroundings that we have in daily life.
            For example, Thailand had improved the health system, and based on the improvement, they were able to make a
            bigger change in the overall economy. The systemic problems are like chains connected to one another, as one
            problem may factor from another by another. By breaking down the problem, and finding the categorizing it
            into systems, designers can find a bigger picture and find a pathway to tackle problems that will solve
            problems.</p>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="dez-h2">How Do We Encourage Failures?</h2>

        <p class="format">Based upon human observations, the CPS is Creative Problem Solving, which Is a method of
          solving a problem. The method was first developed by Alex Osborn.</p>
        <p class="format">He has worked on the creative process based on his work field. He worked on the process and
          developed it with his partner Sydney Parnes. Later on, many other authors have developed their own based on
          Osborn's.</p>
        <p class="format">The first CPS had seven steps, but since then, many authors have refined the model, and now it
          is down to 4 main categories. </p>

        <p class="format">The Model that uses the 4 steps is called the FourSight Model. The categories of the model
          starts from Clarify, Ideate, Develop, and Implement.</p>

        <ol>
          <li class="dez-h3">Clarify: </li>
          <p class="format">clarifying is the stage of understanding the problem. Inspecting the problem, designers are
            to explore
            the problem they have found, and gather the data that. With good understanding of the problem and
            gathering enough data, designers then are to look for ideas that will help solve the problem. It is
            essential that designers fully understand the problem, and then gather data. The data can be collected
            through interviews, observations, ethnography, or traditional research.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="dez-h3">Ideate:</li>
          <p class="format">In the ideate stage, Designers are to brainstorm ideas based on the problem they
            have untangled/clarified. It is recommended for the designers to follow divergent and convergent thinking
            which is the thought process that will help to find a better idea for the problem. In Diverge, designers
            are to bring up any ideas possible that may be a good solution to the problem. It is recommended to bring
            up as many ideas as possible at this stage. Then, in the Cognition thinking process, designers are
            recommended to filter out ideas based on logical thinking and questions asking to oneself whether the idea
            is useful in real life or not.</p>

          <li class="dez-h3">Develop: </li>
          <p class="format">in this stage, designers are to develop the idea they have based on what they
            have from the previous stage. There are different activities designers may use to develop ideas such as
            worst idea possible where designers can bring up all kinds of ideas that would be the worst solution to be
            for the problem, Brain Writing where designers are to bring up good ideas and develop another after the
            previous, and Analogy/Mashup Method where designers may look at other methods and solutions some companies
            may previously have thought of.</p>

          <li class="dez-h3">Implement: </li>
          <p class="format">It is the final stage of CPS method, and where designers are to be put in
            action to what they have as a solution for the problem. However, if there are problems to be found to the
            solution, it is recommended for the designers to go back to the stages of the CPS method and get a better
            solution for it.</p>
