          If you are new at something, success is less likely (Thompson, 2021)
          Making mistakes (Thompson, 2021)

          failing forward in content
          this can occur by having a change of interest or long term sustainability is unlikely, ultimately shifting
          previous goals one may have had.

        <h2 class="dez-h2">How Do We Encourage Failures?</h2>

        <ul class="format">
          <li>You can learn what does not work, and use that as a strategy to learn from your failures, instead of
            moping around over it (Mcgrath, 2011)</li>
          <li>
            It can build a culture that celebrates failure (Mcgath, 2011). Failure can be seen as a learning experience,
            so if people celebrate the “failures” instead of making fun of them, the success of the company will be
            higher.</li>
          <li>
            Sharing what you learn with others is a great way to celebrate failures, as this allows you to feel
            comfortable within the community, and reflect upon that failure with other people (Mcgrath, 2011). </li>
          <li>
            Keep your options open. “You’ll improve your odds if you make more tries” (Mcgrath, 2011).
          </li>
        </ul>

          <ul class="format">
            <li>They get involved in projects by showing interest in them and asking questions about the progress
              (Farson & Keyes, 2002).</li>
            <li>Admitting mistakes, if you make any rather than ignoring them or blaming them on someone else (Farson &
              Keyes, 2002) This allows for empathy to be given from the people that are working there.</li>
            <li>
              Encourage everyone to share ideas with each other and learn from them (Farson & Keyes, 2002).</li>
            <li>
              Listening to each other and adding any thoughts that they think are relevant to the conversation (Farson &
              Keyes, 2002). </li>
            <li>
              Mistakes are okay to make, and are with it because they teach us important lessons (Farson & Keyes, 2002).

          <li class="dez-h3">Embracing Failures</li>
          <p class="format">Encountering challenges and not immediately succeeding is a universal experience. When we
            face such moments, we commonly fall into self-doubt, pondering, "What's wrong with me?" Yet, it's essential
            to grasp that failing to accomplish a specific task doesn't equate to being a failure. Making this
            distinction is pivotal for our growth and continued efforts.

            Countless individuals celebrated for their achievements have navigated through hardships. Their attitude
            towards these obstacles made all the difference. Take Erma Bombeck, for instance, a writer known for her
            wit, who faced significant health challenges. She chose not to view herself as a failure but instead shared
            her journey with humor, illustrating the importance of embracing both the ups and downs. She highlighted the
            crucial difference between identifying as a failure and experiencing failure in certain endeavors. This
            mindset is key.

            This concept is far from novel. Renowned figures like Mozart, Van Gogh, Edison, and Einstein didn't always
            receive acknowledgment for their extraordinary talents. They encountered criticism and setbacks but refused
            to be defined by these moments. They persisted, learned, and progressed, exemplifying the essence of
            perseverance.
            Key takeaways include:
          </p>
          <ul class="format">
            <li>A failure in achieving a specific goal doesn't diminish one's value.</li>
            <li>Setbacks present an opportunity for growth and refinement.</li>
            <li>Mostly success is the result of continuous effort in the face of adversity.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="format">
            Reflect on Rudy's ambition to play football for Notre Dame. Despite not fitting the traditional mold of an
            athlete and facing academic challenges, his unwavering resolve propelled him toward realizing his ambition,
            reinforcing that determination can turn dreams into realities, despite hurdles.

            Ultimately, viewing setbacks as opportunities for learning propels us forward, eliminating self-doubt. This
            mindset fosters resilience and paves the way for achieving our aspirations.

        <h2 class="dez-h2">Conclusion</h2>

        <p class="format">Although failure is viewed as a negative experience and often described as shameful, it is
          important that those experiencing failure understand the positive outcomes that come with it. Being able to
          use failure as a learning experience can enhance quality of problem solving later in life. The understanding
          of what works and what does not becomes more clear and the act of sharing or celebrating these failures can
          bring communities closer ultimately increasing connectivity and empathy with others. Failures should be
          embraced as it is an excellent opportunity to use the experience as an advantage should difficulties arise
          again.</p>

            culmination of your efforts. Therefore, it is wise to treat success and failure alike,"</b></p>
