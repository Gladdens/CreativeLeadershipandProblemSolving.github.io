          this can occur by having a change of interest or long term sustainability is unlikely, ultimately shifting
          previous goals one may have had.

        <h2 class="dez-h2">How Do We Encourage Failures?</h2>

        <ul class="format">
          <li>You can learn what does not work, and use that as a strategy to learn from your failures, instead of
            moping around over it (Mcgrath, 2011)</li>
          <li>
            It can build a culture that celebrates failure (Mcgath, 2011). Failure can be seen as a learning experience,
            so if people celebrate the “failures” instead of making fun of them, the success of the company will be
            higher.</li>
          <li>
            Sharing what you learn with others is a great way to celebrate failures, as this allows you to feel
            comfortable within the community, and reflect upon that failure with other people (Mcgrath, 2011). </li>
          <li>
            Keep your options open. “You’ll improve your odds if you make more tries” (Mcgrath, 2011).

            <li>Admitting mistakes, if you make any rather than ignoring them or blaming them on someone else (Farson &
              Keyes, 2002) This allows for empathy to be given from the people that are working there.</li>
            <li>
              Encourage everyone to share ideas with each other and learn from them (Farson & Keyes, 2002).</li>
            <li>
              Listening to each other and adding any thoughts that they think are relevant to the conversation (Farson &
              Keyes, 2002). </li>

              Mistakes are okay to make, and are with it because they teach us important lessons (Farson & Keyes, 2002).

        <h2 class="dez-h2">Conclusion</h2>

        <p class="format">Although failure is viewed as a negative experience and often described as shameful, it is
          important that those experiencing failure understand the positive outcomes that come with it. Being able to
          use failure as a learning experience can enhance quality of problem solving later in life. The understanding
          of what works and what does not becomes more clear and the act of sharing or celebrating these failures can
          bring communities closer ultimately increasing connectivity and empathy with others. Failures should be
          embraced as it is an excellent opportunity to use the experience as an advantage should difficulties arise
          again.</p>
